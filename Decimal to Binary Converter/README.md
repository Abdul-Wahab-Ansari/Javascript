## Decimal to Binary Converter

This project is based on functionality to convert a decimal number to its binary representation. It consists of an HTML file (`index.html`), a JavaScript file (`script.js`), and a CSS file (`styles.css`).

### Explanation

1. **HTML Structure**: The HTML file contains the structure of the user interface, including an input field for entering the decimal number, a button to trigger the conversion, and an output field to display the binary result.

2. **JavaScript Logic**:
   - The script file retrieves references to the input field, button, and output element using `getElementById`.
   - The `decimalToBinary` function takes a decimal input and calculates its binary representation.
   - Inside `decimalToBinary`, the input is repeatedly divided by 2, and the remainders are stored in an array until the quotient becomes zero.
   - The function then reverses the array of remainders and joins them to form the binary representation, which is displayed in the output field.
   - The `checkUserInput` function ensures that the input is a valid decimal number before converting it to binary.
   - Event listeners are added to the button and input field to trigger the conversion when clicked or when the Enter key is pressed.

3. **Styling**:
   - The CSS file (`styles.css`) provides styling to improve the appearance and layout of the user interface.
   - Font size and text transformation properties are applied to the output element to enhance readability and presentation.

### Usage
1. Enter a decimal number in the input field.
2. Click the "Convert" button or press Enter.
3. The binary representation of the decimal number will be displayed in the output field.

### Note
- The code also includes a commented-out function (`countDownAndUp`) for demonstration purposes, showing recursion behavior. This function is not used in the converter functionality.
- Customize the CSS styles in `styles.css` to modify the appearance of the user interface as needed.
